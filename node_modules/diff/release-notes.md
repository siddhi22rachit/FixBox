# Release Notes

## 8.0.2

- [#616](https://github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/616) **Restored compatibility of `diffSentences` with old Safari versions.** This was broken in 8.0.0 by the introduction of a regex with a [lookbehind assertion](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Lookbehind_assertion); these weren't supported in Safari prior to version 16.4.
- [#612](https://github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/612) **Improved tree shakeability** by marking the built CJS and ESM packages with `sideEffects: false`.

## 8.0.1

- [#610](https://github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/610) **Fixes types for `diffJson` which were broken by 8.0.0**. The new bundled types in 8.0.0 only allowed `diffJson` to be passed string arguments, but it should've been possible to pass either strings or objects (and now is). Thanks to Josh Kelley for the fix.

## 8.0.0

- [#580](https://github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/580) **Multiple tweaks to `diffSentences`**:
  * tokenization no longer takes quadratic time on pathological inputs (reported as a ReDOS vulnerability by Snyk); is now linear instead
  * the final sentence in the string is now handled the same by the tokenizer regardless of whether it has a trailing punctuation mark or not.
